Contribution Driven Economy
---------------------------


Why a Contribution driven Economy?
----------------------------------

- The wealth curve is logarithmic instead of exponential.
- Individual frugality is encouraged and rewarded within a framework of social improvement.
- It can be experimented with and implemented without great disruption to existing economies (even though it is radically different).
- The governance structure inherent in the economic system is scientifically derived and self-correcting.


Summary Definition
------------------

A Contribution Driven Economy is an [unplanned][1] [market economy][2] with an [energy-based currency][3] and a [universal basic income][4]. All services available in a Contribution Driven Economy that make up the infrastructure of society are developed and maintained using public contributions (crowd-funded), it is therefore a form of [direct-democracy][5]. Since all infrastructure and services are funded by the public, they are [owned in common][6] and run for the benefit of the public.

About
-----

A Contribution Driven Economy is a socio-economic system where production and governance-related decisions are driven by the direct contributions of the people. Contributions are made by individuals in the form of payments into funds for Projects that they want to see implemented. Projects can be business-like enterprises (such as a restaurant or a factory), public services (such as a sports-centre or a transport link), or governmental schemes (such as building a hospital or improving a public park). The terms business enterprise, public service, and governmental scheme do not have much meaningful distinction in a Contribution Driven Economy (they are all just Projects), they are used here to aid understanding.

Projects are funded by groups of individuals but are owned by everyone; the contributions are used as a way to initially vote for a Project, to fund its implementation, and to maintain it if needed. The goods, services, and other beneficial outputs of any Project are owned in common by society, and must be purchased by entities (individuals or Projects) who wish to use or consume them. The income from such sales goes to the Project to cover their costs, so the burden of provision is paid for by those who consume it the most. Another way of thinking about this is that the 'availability' of goods and services is owned by everyone, but the actual provision and consumption is covered by the entities who use it.

It is difficult to classify a Contribution Driven Economy into any existing well-known ideology because it shares many traits with other ideologies such as Capitalism, Socialism, Anarchism, and various Post-Capitalism propositions. It has been conceived to minimise the negative aspects of these other systems and maximise their positive aspects, whilst remaining practical and achievable within current technical and political constraints. Technically a Contribution Driven Economy is economically a form of Socialism (because the means of production are owned in common), and politically it is a form of Direct Democracy (because governmental initiatives are voted for directly by contributions). However, such labels usually confuse people, who all have different understandings of what they mean. Post-capitalism is probably the most accurate ideological bucket to put it in (since the definition of post-capitalism is quite broad), but that suggests it is something which comes after capitalism whereas a Contribution Driven Society can co-exist in parallel with a capitalist one.


Money
-----

The currency used in a contribution driven economy is completely electronic and all transactions are cleared immediately and accounted for automatically. The currency unit is tied to the electrical energy production of the society, meaning the amount of 'money' available in the economy is directly related to the ability of the society to perform useful work. Each person has an income allocation which is given to them every day, regardless of their employment status. The income allocation is calculated by sharing out all of the daily energy production between all members of the society, based on a personal Income-Factor. Individuals can increase their personal Income-Factor by contributing to society - by paying some of their money into qualifying Project funds instead of spending it on themselves. In addition to the free income allowance, individuals can have jobs working for a Project to earn additional income. Individuals can save money up to a limit determined by their Savings-Factor. Like the Income-Factor, the Savings-Factor can be increased by contributing to society. At the end of each day, any excess money above an individual's savings limit is automatically contributed into Project funds according to rules set up by the individual.


Contributions
-------------

For every unit of currency contributed to a qualifying Project, individuals earn Contribution-Points. Contribution-Points can be spent to increase an individual's Income-Factor and Savings-Factor to the next level (Level-up). The cost to increase these factors increases with each Level-up, which means that richer individuals (with a high Income-Factor) need to contribute more in order to Level-up and increase their income. This is what creates the logarithmic wealth curve.

Paying for Goods and Services
-----------------------------

TODO


Politics and Government
-----------------------

Contributions are equivalent to votes, because all Projects are directly funded by contributions there is no need for taxation-based government revenue and no need for a central government to make decisions on how to spend public money. This approach of direct-democracy and fully transparent automated accounting for Projects allows people to 'vote' for the Projects they want by their contributions instead of electing a government to make those decisions for them. This means anyone can become a policy-maker simply by setting up a Project, evangelising it, and ultimately getting people to ‘vote’ for it by contributing to it, in order to realise it.

Governing bodies are still needed for things like managing the laws, refining rules around what projects qualify for contribution points. Scientific bodies would agree the true-cost of things where 'externalities' occurr.


# Unorganised notes below here #

Ownership:
Access to goods and services - access not ownership.
All natural resources are owned in common by all people, so land and property ownership are not necessary - instead you rent things, you rent it from society as a whole, including yourself.

Projects:
TODO: Set-up, merging, employment, spending, transparency, control of funds.

Paying for Goods and Services:

TODO: Costs based on input costs of project. Encourages good competition and improvement, frugality of projects as well as individuals. Costs should include over-charges, and the true-cost of some types of goods/service (for example environmental impact can be valued by how much energy it would take to clean up or un-do).

Benefits:

* Encourages frugality
* Automated accounting - frees up humans to focus on useful stuff
* No need for taxation! :) - frees up humans to focus on useful stuff
* No debt (no interest!) - funds must be raised in advance of project implementation.
* Anyone can get involved and informed about public spending, or take a back-seat if they prefer.
* Everyone is both an investor and philanthropist and therefore has more reason to learn about and be concerned with society and how it works, so that they can make better-informed decisions.
* People need to think more about where 'stuff' comes from and how it gets there in society (shifts mindset towards post-scarcity economics).
* It encourages participation in democracy and removes the excuse that it's someone else's job to solve or this-or-that - “what can *we* do about it?”  - fix it!
* Contributions are a form of giving, and there is strong evidence that giving makes you happy, so people will be happier.
* Capitalist ‘incentive’ to improve your personal situation is still maintained, but the way to get rich is to contribute more over time!
* Wealth curve is logarithmic instead of exponential.
* Massively less human labour needed to maintain this society - 95% of legal system gone, insurance, policing, investigations, governments, etc. all reduced or gone.

Over-charging:

Over-charge replaces the term profit. It includes insurance, wastage, contingency, management bonuses, enforced contributions, etc. Over-charges can also be refunded if it turned out they weren’t necessary (e.g. insurance, or unused contingency funds) - in this context means the user can choose to redirect the contribution somewhere else and still gain the contribution points. This replaces ‘profit’ and consumers can see what component of their payments for goods and services are an ‘over-charge’ and what parts relate to the direct costs of supply. Projects can add contingency and state their policy such as “unused contingency over-charges will be invested into Project <whatever> - earning contribution points” or “unused contingency over-charges will be redirected by the customer”. So for example your transport costs might include a small overcharge for contingency, at the end of the year only 10% of the contingency fund might have been used and 90% of your overcharges are refunded back to you, to redirect into other Projects. This system brings insurance a bit more in-house and removes the ‘profit’ from the insurance industry entirely, a project might exist to help other projects with their risk assessment as a service, but they themselves would only be charging their costs, natural competition would ensure that Projects use such outsourced services or in-house risk assessment according to what’s the most efficient for them. It also prevents price-competition from forcing projects to underestimate how much contingency they might need, leading to bail-outs being needed if something goes wrong.

Local Funds:

Like a payment to your local council, they choose how to spend it so you don't have to. Probably there would be multiple sub-Projects so you could contribute to those directly if you prefer. This would not be a well-defined part of a contribution-driven-economy, it’s more something I think would emerge naturally. So you may still ‘vote’ for your local council for example, to choose how to spend the local fund. This would be up to local people to organise rather than a regimented rule of government/society, it’s just an example of the type of thing that would probably happen rather than part of the definition.

Local funds would be borderless. The Project organisers may define which areas they will develop, maintain, improve, etc. but individuals living in one of these areas may prefer to donate to a different local fund (as with any Project), or multiple local funds, depending on what areas they want to contribute to.

Law and Order:

??? Not really up to me to decide (as the designer of an economic system rather than a political one), but I’d say we need some basic maxims from which it can be decided if something is ‘right’ or ‘wrong’ - too often at the moment I see laws being blindly followed to the detriment of their original purpose. We need to go back a step and say “this law was created because of X, does this current situation satisfy X or not?” rather than “is this badly-drafted law technically broken or not?”.

One good thing would be that crime could be made to actually not pay. If you do something wrong like assault or rob someone, you can be forced to pay them compensation through your free-income that everyone gets. If you were somehow fraudulent and earned loads of ill-gotten contribution points, these can be taken away (contribution points don’t represent money directly, so you can just destroy them without any problem, more like EXP in a RPG, so you could be forced to level-down and remove the extra income from your fraudulent activity). When someone levels down like this, everyone else gets a fraction more because of how the funds are distributed.

Health:

??? Some problems here because of perceived personal risk. People won’t feel they need to contribute enough to public health-care because of the “it won’t happen to me” factor. Society might need to offer other incentives (perhaps double contribution points up to a limit) in order to properly fund such services.

Education:

Pick-your-own subjects. Meet dependencies, level-up in different educational areas, specialist subjects level-1 might require level-10 in a few different general-subjects in order to begin. This is more top-down education, starting from the desired outcome of the child - i.e. what big complicated thing do they want to know about that is currently way beyond their comprehension. Then you look at that and say well you need these subjects to understand it, and you need these subjects to do those subjects, so the child always understands WHY they are learning something instead of being fed stuff that is seemingly irrelevant to them at the time and only becomes clear why it is needed later on in life.

Emergent Behaviour:

Ad-hoc work availability (show-up-and-work) - no taxes, no work permits. Local funds (councils) could raise funds for a park-cleanup or whatever and then get people from all walks of life who want to do a bit of work to help improve something, and they can even get paid too, so they can earn extra contribution points by re-investing that pay back into the local fund or any other fund. Double-points when re-invested straight back (for example). This can help people who actually physically contribute to society (as well as just paying into funds) to earn a little extra contribution points.

Takeovers - Don't like how Org-X is being run? Start a project which is a campaign to take over, state what you'll do differently, get people to stop contributing to Org-X and start contributing to Alt-Org-X. If you have enough impact you get to take your raised funds to Org-X and do things differently. This is decided by the public by their contributions, if Alt-Org-X gets funding to "do it this way" and Org-X doesn't get enough to "do it that way" then it's clear what the public wants.

Implementation notes:

Can operate as a corporate entity or country, with an economic border. CD-Society can purchase/sell with external capitalist ones. Once the improvements are apparent, growth/adoption can spread organically.
