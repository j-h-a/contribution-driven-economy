## Is cash allowed in a Contribution Driven Economy?

Yes. Anyone can propose a Project to create and manage a cash-based currency. If enough people feel that a physical cash-based representation of money would be a useful thing to have then they will contribute to it and provide the Project with enough funds to get started and keep going. The cost of maintaining the Project might come from further contributions or from the users of the service.

## Why "Contribution Driven Economy" rather than "Contribution Driven Society"?

This concept defines how the economy works, society itself builds upon this economic framework to decide how Society is governed. "Society" to me suggests both an economic and political system, but in an unplanned economy the political system is mostly a by-product of the economy (or at least heavily influenced or corrupted by it), so I prefer Contribution Driven Economy.

There would inter-personal 'politics' within and around the Project organisations, if someone wants to change something they just need to start a Project and garner support for it, that would involve politics for sure, but there's no well-defined political system in place that they need to negotiate in order to get things done. When talking about a Contribution Driven Economy, in some contexts it makes more sense to refer to a Contribution Driven Society. Since economic systems have such a great influence over how society operates, these two terms are interchangeable and should be interpreted to mean the same thing. A Contribution Driven Society simply means a society that employs a Contribution Driven Economy as its primary economic operating model.

## What influences led to the development of the Contribution Driven Economy?

I first got interested in economics when I watched Peter Joseph's Zeitgeist movies and learned about The Venus Project through those films. The Venus Project focuses on the negative aspects of capitalism and tries to eliminate them, proposing a post-scarcity moneyless society where scientific analysis and reasoning determines the planning of resource-management and production, and advanced automated technology executes and delivers upon that plan.

When I was learning about how capitalism works these negative aspects stood out the most and The Venus Project had some great analysis of their causes. They also appeared to have many answers to these problems, but the more I learned the more I saw the benefits of unplanned market economics and the huge disadvantages of planned economies. I also saw the technical flaws in the proposals of The Venus Project, the main problem being that it requires a huge amount of infrastructure to be in place and it requires advanced technology that is currently only theory. The whole thing seemed like a great idea, but it was only practical if it already existed. The moneyless concept might be something to aspire towards as a society, but I think that would be a natural consequence of a succesful peaceful society, rather than the menas to get there.

I wanted to find a way to incorporate the positive aspects of capitalism into my ideology rather than rejecting it completely, so I started to research many different ideas and come up with a few of my own to help me define a Contribution Driven Economy.
